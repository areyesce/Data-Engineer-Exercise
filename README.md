Draft documentation describing how a reviewer can run your app locally. Be sure to include steps like installing dependencies or other “pre-flight” configurations necessary for your code to run.


## Install the following dependencies: 
* install python3 
* pip3 install pandas

## Run app locally
* python3 producePeopleFile.py
  * creates 'people.csv' file
* python3 produceAcquisitionFactsFile.py
  * creates 'acquisition_facts.csv'; can only execute this line after creating 'people.csv' in previous step
